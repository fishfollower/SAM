\description{
The function estimates reference points based on stochastic model forecasts.
}
\details{
The following reference points are implemented:
\describe{
   \item{F=x}{F fixed to x, e.g., \code{"F=0.3"} (NOT IMPLEMENTED YET)}
   \item{StatusQuo}{F in the last year of the assessment (NOT IMPLEMENTED YET)}
   \item{StatusQuo-y}{F in the y years before the last in the assessment, e.g., \code{"StatusQuo-1"} (NOT IMPLEMENTED YET)}
   \item{MSY}{F that maximizes yield}
   \item{0.xMSY}{Fs that gives 0.x*100\% of MSY, e.g., \code{"0.95MSY"}}
   \item{Max}{F that maximizes yield per recruit (NOT IMPLEMENTED YET)}
   \item{0.xdYPR}{F such that the derivative of yield per recruit is 0.x times the derivative at F=0, e.g., \code{"0.1dYPR"} (NOT IMPLEMENTED YET)}
   \item{0.xSPR}{F such that spawners per recruit is 0.x times spawners per recruit at F=0, e.g., \code{"0.35SPR"} (NOT IMPLEMENTED YET)}
   \item{0.xB0}{F such that biomass is 0.x times the biomass at F=0, e.g., \code{"0.2B0"} (NOT IMPLEMENTED YET)}
}
Reference points can be estimated using these methods:
\describe{
   \item{Mean}{Use least squares to estimate mean equilibrium values}
   \item{Q0.x}{Use quantile regression to estimate the 0.x quantile of equilibrium values}
   \item{Median}{Identical to Q0.5}
   \item{Mode}{(NOT IMPLEMENTED YET)}
}
To estimate median equilibrium yield, as required by ICES, the method "Q0.5" should be used.
