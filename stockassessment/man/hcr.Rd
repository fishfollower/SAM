\usage{
hcr(fit, ...)

\method{hcr}{sam}(fit, nYears = 20, Ftarget, Btrigger, Flim = 0,
  Blim = 0, Flow = 0, Blow = 0, nosim = 10000,
  ave.years = max(fit$data$years) + (-4:0), rec.years = c(),
  preForecast = list(), ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{fit}{A SAM fit}

\item{...}{other variables used by the methods}

\item{nYears}{Number of years to forecast}

\item{Ftarget}{Target F for high SSB}

\item{Btrigger}{SSB that triggers the control rule}

\item{Flim}{F used for SSB = Blim}

\item{Blim}{Between Blim and Btrigger, F values are selected based on linear interpolation from Flim to Ftarget}

\item{Flow}{F used for SSB < Blow}

\item{Blow}{SSB for which Flow is used below}

\item{nosim}{Number of simulations to do. If NULL a model forecast based on the Laplace approximation is used}

\item{ave.years}{vector of years to average for weights, maturity, M and such}

\item{rec.years}{vector of years to use to resample recruitment from. If an empty vector is given, recruitment is based on the fitted model.}

\item{preForecast}{list of forecast parameters (i.e., fval, fscale, catchval, landval, or nextssb) to use before the HCR}

\item{fit}{A SAM fit}

\item{...}{additional arguments passed to \link{modelforecast}}

\description{
The formula below is used to determine a new F based on the previous SSB.
\deqn{F = \left\{
              \begin{array}{ll}
                  F_{low} & SSB < B_{low} \\
                  min\left(Ftarget, \max\left( F_{lim}, (SSB - B_{lim}) \cdot (F_{target} - F_{lim}) / (B_{trigger}-B_{lim}) \right)\right) & SSB \ge B_{low}
              \end{array}\right.
