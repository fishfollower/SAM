  Borigin = 0,

\arguments{
\item{fit}{A SAM fit}

\item{...}{additional arguments passed to \link{modelforecast}}

\item{nYears}{Number of years to forecast}

\item{Ftarget}{Target F for high SSB}

\item{Btrigger}{SSB that triggers the control rule}

\item{Forigin}{F used for SSB = Borigin}

\item{Borigin}{Between Blim and Btrigger, F values are selected based on linear interpolation from Forigin to Ftarget}

\item{Fcap}{F for SSB < Bcap}

\item{Bcap}{SSB for which Fcap is used below}

\item{nosim}{Number of simulations to do. If NULL a model forecast based on the Laplace approximation is used}

\item{ave.years}{vector of years to average for weights, maturity, M and such}

\item{rec.years}{vector of years to use to resample recruitment from. If an empty vector is given, recruitment is based on the fitted model.}

\item{preForecast}{list of forecast parameters (i.e., fval, fscale, catchval, landval, or nextssb) to use before the HCR}

\item{currentSSB}{if TRUE, SSB at the begining of the control rule year is used. If FALSE, SSB at the begining of the previous year is used.}

\description{
The formula below is used to determine a new F based on the previous SSB.
\deqn{F = \left\{
              \begin{array}{ll}
                  F_{cap} & SSB < B_{cap} \\
                  min\left(Ftarget, \max\left( F_{origin}, (SSB - B_{origin}) \cdot (F_{target} - F_{origin}) / (B_{trigger}-B_{origin}) \right)\right) & SSB \ge B_{origin}
              \end{array}\right.
