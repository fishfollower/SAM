## Arguments

Argument      |Description
------------- |----------------
`fit`     |     an assessment object of type sam, as returned from the function sam.fit
`fscale`     |     a vector of f-scales. See details.
`catchval`     |     a vector of target catches. See details.
`catchval.exact`     |     a vector of target catches which will be met without noise. See details.
`fval`     |     a vector of target f values. See details.
`nextssb`     |     a vector target SSB values the following year. See details
`landval`     |     a vector of target catches. See details.
`cwF`     |     a vector target custom weighted F values. customWeights must also be specified
`nosim`     |     number of simulations default is 1000
`year.base`     |     starting year default last year in assessment. Currently it is only supported to use last assessment year or the year before
`ave.years`     |     vector of years to average for weights, maturity, M and such
`rec.years`     |     vector of years to use to resample recruitment from
`label`     |     optional label to appear in short table
`overwriteSelYears`     |     if a vector of years is specified, then the average selectivity of those years is used (not recommended)
`deterministic`     |     option to turn all process noise off (not recommended, as it will likely cause bias)
`processNoiseF`     |     option to turn off process noise in F
`customWeights`     |     a vector of same length as number of age groups giving custom weights (currently only used for weighted average of F calculation)
`customSel`     |     supply a custom selection vector that will then be used as fixed selection in all years after the final assessment year (not recommended)
`lagR`     |     if the second youngest age should be reported as recruits
`splitLD`     |     if TRUE the result is split in landing and discards
`addTSB`     |     if TRUE the total stock biomass (TSB) is added
`useSWmodel`     |     if TRUE the catch mean weight predicted from the assessment model is used (can only be used for configurations supporting this)
`useCWmodel`     |     if TRUE the catch mean weight predicted from the assessment model is used (can only be used for configurations supporting this)
`useMOmodel`     |     if TRUE the proportion mature predicted from the assessment model is used (can only be used for configurations supporting this)
`useNMmodel`     |     if TRUE the natural mortality predicted from the assessment model is used (can only be used for configurations supporting this)
`savesim`     |     save the individual simulations
`cf.cv.keep.cv`     |     exotic option
`cf.cv.keep.fv`     |     exotic option
`cf.keep.fv.offset`     |     exotic option
`estimate`     |     the summary function used (typically mean or median)


## Details

There are three ways to specify a scenario. If e.g. four F values are specified (e.g. fval=c(.1,.2,.3,4)), then the first value is used in the last assessment year (base.year), and the three following in the three following years. Alternatively F's can be specified by a scale, or a target catch. Only one option can be used per year. So for instance to set a catch in the first year and an F-scale in the following one would write catchval=c(10000,NA,NA,NA), fscale=c(NA,1,1,1). The length of the vector specifies how many years forward the scenarios run.


## Value

an object of type samforecast
