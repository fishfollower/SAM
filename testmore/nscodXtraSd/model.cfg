$keyLogFsta
# Coupling of the fishing mortality states processes for each age (normally only 
# the first row (= fleet) is used). 
# Sequential numbers indicate that the fishing mortality is estimated individually 
# for those ages; if the same number is used for two or more ages, F is bound for 
# those ages (assumed to be the same). Binding fully selected ages will result in a 
# flat selection pattern for those ages.

$corFlag
# Correlation of fishing mortality across ages (0 independent, 1 compound symmetry, 
# 2 AR(1), 3 separable AR(1). 
# 0: independent means there is no correlation between F across age 
# 1: compound symmetry means that all ages are equally correlated; 
# 2: AR(1) first order autoregressive - similar ages are more highly correlated than 
# ages that are further apart, so similar ages have similar F patterns over time. 
# if the estimated correlation is high, then the F pattern over time for each age 
# varies in a similar way. E.g if almost one, then they are parallel (like a 
# separable model) and if almost zero then they are independent. 
# 3: Separable AR - Included for historic reasons . . .  more later
